    "description": "Threat Modeling Exercise  \n---------------------------------  \n  \nThe Unicorn Horn is a new GEHC imaging device.  It is used to measure karma within a patient by emitting pixie dust at them.  The system comes in two configurations - one is very large and is installed in a fixed exam room, the other is able to walk around the hospital.    \n  \nBoth configurations use ethernet and 802.11 wireless to talk to hospital and internet systems.  Proprietary communication is used to update the system (version and configuration) from the internet-based cloud and rainbow servers.  The Unicorn horn emitter must be configured to each patient properly, based on the DICOM Worklist or local configuration.  Failure to use a proper configuration could result in harm to the patient.    \n  \nThe system uses a postgres database to store all results and configuration.  Access is limited to the local system and software.  \n  \nThe results of scans are very confidential, as they describe how truly good a person is, and they would never like to share this to the public.  Results are stored locally, and sent to PACS.  Reports may be exported to local USB media from the customer, emailed to the customer, or uploaded to the Cloud Rainbow for online sharing.  The system supports user roles of Administrator, Operator, and Service.  Remote service is possible by GEHC using Insite2."
